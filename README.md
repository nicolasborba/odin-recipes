# odin-recipes
This is the first hands-on project in the "Foundations Couse" of The 
Odin Project.

The objective is to create a basic recipe website, consisting of a main 
index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The website is not meant to look pretty in this initial phase, as we're 
working on it's basic structure as a learning exercise, but we will come 
back to this project in the future and make it look better.
